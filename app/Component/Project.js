              I developed this sleek and modern landing page using Next.js to

              a minimalistic layout with a vibrant color scheme that highlights
              key elements like the navigation bar and call-to-action buttons.
              This combination of visuals and Next.js functionality ensures a

              JavaScript, it allows users to seamlessly switch between projects
              using navigation buttons. The slider is responsive, ensuring a
              smooth experience across different devices. Each slide includes an
              image and a brief description, providing a quick overview of each
              projectâ€™s key features and outcomes.
